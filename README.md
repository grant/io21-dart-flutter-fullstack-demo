# Dart / Flutter - full stack demo for Cloud Run

This is a demo of a full stack application built with [Dart] and [Flutter].

The **frontend** is a desktop Flutter app that sends a name that you enter to
the backend and then displays the response (a greeting in various languages) in
a snackbar (an ephemeral popup widget for displaying messages at the bottom of
the page).

The **backend** is a Dart function app that was generated using the
[Functions Framework for Dart]. It serves an HTTP endpoint that accepts a
JSON-encoded request body and returns a JSON-encoded response body. For the
demo, the function is hosted on `localhost` and on [Cloud Run], a fully
managed serverless platform on [Google Cloud].

## Requirements

- Dart: >=2.12.0 <3.0.0

## Build and deploy the backend

Change directory to `backend`.

```shell
cd backend
```

### Local machine

You can run the function on your local machine by entering:

```shell
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
dart run bin/server.dart --port=8080 --target=function
```

If you have `make` installed on your system, you can just enter:

```shell
make run
```

Output:
```shell
Listening on :8080
```

For more details see [backend/README].

### Cloud Run

If you have created a Google Cloud project and updated your local `gcloud`
configuration with the project ID, you can deploy the backend in a single step.

For example, assuming your project ID is `dart-demo` and you want
to deploy the function as a service called `greeting`, enter:

```shell
gcloud beta run deploy greeting --allow-unauthenticated --source=.
```

Output:
```shell
Building using Dockerfile and deploying container to Cloud Run service [greeting] in project [dart-demo] region [us-central1]

Service [greeting] revision [greeting-00001-yen] has been deployed and is 
serving 
100 percent of traffic.
Service URL: https://greeting-gpua4upw6q-uc.a.run.app
```

The function app endpoint is the Service URL printed on the last line.

See [Quickstart: Cloud Run] for details on setting up and using a Google 
Cloud project.

### Verify the backend works

If you have `curl` installed on your system, you can enter the following:

```shell
URL=http://localhost:8080  # or your Cloud Run service URL
curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{ "name": "World" }' -w "\n" $URL
````

Output (example):
```shell
{"salutation":"Hello","name":"World"}
```

## Build and run the frontend

Change directory to `frontend`.

```shell
cd frontend
```

The following assumes running on the `macos` desktop.

### Backend running on local machine

```shell
flutter run -d macos
```

or

```shell
flutter run -d macos -t lib/main_dev.dart
```

### Backend running on Cloud Run

```shell
export GREETING_URL={Cloud Run service URL}
flutter run -d macos -t lib/main_prod.dart
```
